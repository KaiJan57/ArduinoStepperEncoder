# ArduinoStepperEncoder
Directly connect a bipolar stepper motor to four adcs of your arduino to get a rotary encoder
Connect one coil to A0 and A1; the other one to A2 and A3. If connected properly, this program will send characters representing the movement of the stepper.
If nothing is sent, try to flip A0 and A1.
